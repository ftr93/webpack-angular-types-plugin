## Product

Interfaces need to be annotated with `@include-docs` for the type information to be generated.

> **Note**
>
> Type-only modules (TypeScript files that only contain `type`s and `interface`s) are eliminated
> during compilation and thus, cannot be analyzed.
>
> Add at least one **used** constant or function declaration to the file containing the interface.
